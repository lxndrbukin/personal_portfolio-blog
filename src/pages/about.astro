    Hey, I’m Alex — an aspiring Python Developer on the path to becoming an AI
    Engineer.
  </p>

  <p>
    My journey into tech started with web development. For several years, I
    explored JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, and React, trying to break into
    the field as a web developer. But along the way, I realized two things:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>First</b>, I didn’t yet have the discipline, motivation, or structured
      roadmap needed to truly master it.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Second</b>, as I kept learning, I discovered that web development
      wasn’t the right fit for me after all.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Those experiences weren’t wasted, though. They taught me persistence, gave
    me a foundation in programming, and most importantly helped me figure out
    where my real passion lies: <b
      >Artificial Intelligence and Python development</b
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, I’ve shifted my focus completely. I’m diving deep into Python,
    strengthening my fundamentals, and gradually making my way into AI
    engineering. This blog/portfolio is where I’ll share projects, write about
    what I’m learning, and track the progress of turning this vision into a
    career.
  </p>

  <p>
    If there’s one thing my path so far has taught me, it’s that false starts
    aren’t failures — they’re stepping stones. Now I know exactly where I’m
    headed, and I’m more motivated than ever to get there.
